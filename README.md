# Mini Projects

Now you know the basics and the next step is to apply the knowledge and create something useful, this repository contains few mini projects.

## Getting Ready
During the online lessons your instructor will likely be using Github Codespaces to edit their code. For newcomers it is recommended to do the same.  

_Note: A local environment is still the best option, if you have already set it up for yourself._

You may also choose to use other web based code editors such as [Gitpod](https://www.gitpod.io/) or [codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/), but please be aware that you should be comfortable with configuring and managing these environments on your own.
